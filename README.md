# anime-list
This project starts with the idea of creating a web application to manage a list of anime. The application is created with React and uses the Jikan API `https://api.jikan.moe/v4/anime` to obtain information of the anime. On this page, you can search for the anime that you like the most and see its score in `https://myanimelist.net/`
